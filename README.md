**Horizon 2020**
**H2020-EO-2014 New ideas for Earth-relevant Space Applications**

The EUSTACE project produced:

* Surface air temperature estimates (with estimates of uncertainty) for all surfaces of Earth, derived from satellite surface skin temperature retrievals
* Global daily analyses of surface air temperature (with estimates of uncertainty) since 1850, based on combined information from satellite and in situ data sources

This repo contains the research code used to produce these data products.

The code has been archived here to facilitate accessibility, however the system has a dependency to run from an SVN repository and requires access to the JASMIN CEMS academic computing system, as outlined in the documentation.

The data products are available via the [CEDA archive](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/a52b2cc065a847b8a77a93896880349f)

This repo is archived and static - we are not able to reply to comments, suggestions for improvements, bug fixes or pull requests.

EUSTACE has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation, under Grant Agreement no. 640171
